    "- ARIMA models are well-known for their simplicity and interpretability. They can capture various patterns in time series data, including trends and seasonality (when using SARIMA).\n",
    "- ARIMA is effective for short-term forecasting when the data shows clear autocorrelations.\n",
    "- It is widely used in academic and professional settings for demand forecasting, making it a reliable choice.\n",

    "- It's a well-established method in time series forecasting, making it a good baseline model.\n",
    "- It's relatively easy to interpret, which helps in explaining the model's decisions.\n",
