# Demand-Forecasting

### Goal
Develop a demand forecasting system for a short-term period (14 days) starting from 7 days after the last date in the data, for all product groups.

### Description:
1. Using the provided transaction data, create two forecasting models:
- Machine learning model.
- Classical time series forecasting model.
2. Provide justified comments regarding the choice of methods and approaches, explaining why you chose them.
3. Provide a script or notebook (.py/.ipynb) containing the technical solution and the ability to calculate the forecast for the future period (scoring).

### Expected result
A file with code (.py or .ipynb) that includes two forecasting models, explanations of method choices, and the ability to calculate the forecast for the future period.
